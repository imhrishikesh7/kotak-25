                    <p className='mb-2'>
                        Central to our transformation journey lies a deep commitment to
                        customer centricity. We have realigned our functions and worked
                        on our strategy around this principle.
                    </p>

                    <p className='mb-2'>
                        The Consumer Bank has been strategically organised into three
                        core segments i.e. Product, Distribution and Proposition. The
                        Distribution segment engages customers through three distinct
                        channels — branch network, digital and voice. Each channel is
                        now persona-driven whether SME, affluent or others, influencing
                        everything from branch staffing to app design and functionality.
                    </p>

                    <p className='mb-2'>
                        Leveraging our comprehensive product suite, we have crafted
                        bespoke solutions tailored to the distinct needs of our target
                        customer segments. Our offerings span essential financial use
                        cases including saving, investing, borrowing and protection,
                        drawing on the strengths and capabilities of our Group
                        companies to deliver integrated and impactful propositions. A manifestation of this approach is evident in the recent launch of
                        Kotak Solitaire, our new proposition for the affluent customers.
                    </p>

                    <p className='mb-2'>
                        Furthermore, all three segments work on deepening customer
                        engagement, guided by defined personas right from the
                        onboarding stage through co-origination of products and
                        continuing across the customer lifecycle with personalised
                        nudges and targeted offers.

                    <p className='mb-2'>
                        To elevate customer service at our branches, we have focused
                        on two key areas: branch decongestion and optimising the
                        time our colleagues spend on operational tasks. Decongestion
                        is achieved by redirecting customer interactions to digital and
                        voice channels, ensuring faster and more convenient service. For
                        customers who continue to visit branches, we have enhanced
                        operational efficiency through our frontline digitisation
                        initiatives. These include the Transaction Authorisation System
                        (TAS), automation of daily branch reports and an AI-powered
                        bot, each designed to streamline workflows and empower
                        branch staff to deliver superior service.

                    The wholesale bank continued on its journey towards excellence
                    by reducing reliance on asset-based revenues and enhancing
                    customer flow-led and fee income streams. In light of the falling
                    interest rate environment, wholesale banking focused on short-term
                    and working capital lending to optimise returns and manage
                    interest rate risk more effectively. Trade and Supply Chain offerings
                    were strengthened, including through digital offerings and this led
                    to increased share of customer flows and higher liability and fee
                    incomes. Continued focus on customer experience, productivity and
                    digital enhancements led to strong growth in Assets, Liabilities and
                    Profitability, delivering a healthy ATROE.

                    to raise debt financing from capital markets and loan markets at
                    competitive rates. The Bank strengthened its leadership position in debt financing and was recognised as ‘India’s Best Investment Bank
                    for Financing’ by Euromoney Excellence Awards, 2025.
                    We also grew our non-credit income from Forex, Cash Management
                    Services (CMS) and Transaction Banking, steadily increasing the
                    proportion of non-risk revenues and enhancing Return on Equity
                    through a more favourable earnings mix.

                    We continued our digital-first, solution-oriented approach in CMS,

                <p className='mb-2'>
                    This year, there was an increased focus on digitisation of
                    transactions for better customer experience, improved productivity
                    and reduced TATs. Kotak fyn, the Bank’s integrated portal for
                    collections, payments, trade and account services saw significant
                    growth in adoption. Kotak fyn’s capabilities were expanded through
                    the introduction of new products, service requests and DIY journeys.
                    Its omni-channel proposition was further strengthened through
                    introduction of Trade Approvals on the fyn App.

                <p className='mb-2'>
                    For the merchant ecosystem, we have developed the ‘Sampark Setu’
                    platform, a Bank-level unified platform, designed in-house to include
                    all digital payment modes.

                <p className='mb-2'>
                    The Cash Management Services technology stack was enhanced
                    by making available native APIs. This has helped the wholesale

                    India’s #1 ECM House, Now in Top 10 Globally

                <p className='mb-2'>
                    Kotak Investment Bank has maintained its position as India’s #1
                    ECM house for the third consecutive year and further reinforced
                    its leadership by topping Asia’s IPO league tables<sup>@</sup> and breaking
                    into the LSEG global top 10 ranking.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-2'>
                    We successfully completed 31 ECM transactions, including
                    18 IPOs, 11 QIPs, 1 REIT QIP and 1 Rights Issue in FY 2024-25.
                    These include marquee transactions such as Hyundai (India’s
                    largest listing till date), Swiggy (Asia’s fourth-largest listing) and
                    Hexaware (largest Indian IT services IPO globally in a decade),
                    along with 15 other notable listings during the year.
                </p>

                <p className='mb-2'>
                    On the advisory side, we led several high-impact and complex
                    deals. Key among them were acting as a buy-side advisor and
                    managing the open offer for the acquisition of joint control in
                    Manappuram Finance by Bain Capital, serving as an exclusive financial advisor to the Godrej family in the re-alignment of
                    ownership within their group and providing buy-side advisory
                    to the Carlyle Group for the creation of a diversified global auto
                    components platform. In addition, we executed eight other
                    advisory transactions, further reinforcing our position as a
                    trusted financial advisor in high-impact, complex deals.
