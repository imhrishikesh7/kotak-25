            Our governance approach is guided by four core principles:
            accountability, responsibility, independence and transparency.
            These principles are reinforced by a diverse and independent
            Board of Directors, comprehensive and transparent policies,
            robust risk management framework and advanced cybersecurity
            measures. By combining these elements, we foster a culture
            of integrity, transparency and responsible banking practices
            that benefits all stakeholders. This framework not only fosters
            stakeholder trust but also ensures regulatory compliance and
            drives long-term sustainability as we pursue excellence.

            The Bank's Board of Directors (Board) plays a vital role
            in safeguarding and enhancing shareholders' capital. To
            achieve this, our Board has, amongst other things, fostered
            effective management, inculcated compliance culture,
            adopted best practices and nurtured responsible leadership.
            We have also adopted several key policies that underpin our

            frequency of DR drills for critical and non-critical applications.
            The IT DR Plan specifies the Recovery Time Objective (RTO).
            RTO is the period of time within which IT infrastructure, systems,
            applications and databases must be recovered at the DR site.
            The Bank has demonstrated its capability to move all critical
            and dependent business and infrastructure applications to DR
            site and operate from there for extended periods. This has been
            tested thrice in FY 2024-25.

              We provide comprehensive induction training, including
              dedicated modules on cybersecurity awareness to all our new
              employees. We also have mandatory annual refresher courses
              on information security for all staff. In addition, the Information
              Risk Management (IRM) and Chief Information Security Officer
              (CISO) teams regularly share security updates and best practices,
              fostering a culture of awareness across the organisation. We
              have targeted awareness sessions to help employees identify
              phishing attempts and malicious software.

              All Bank employees are required to complete the Information
              Security course annually on MyLearn, the Bank’s Learning
              Management System. This initiative ensures a consistent and
              organisation-wide understanding of data protection practices,
              reinforces a culture of cybersecurity across the ecosystem. We
              embed cybersecurity awareness and governance excellence
              across all levels of the Bank. Our Board is regularly updated on
              key cybersecurity matters, reinforcing oversight and alignment
              with best-in-class practices. In FY 2024-25, ~72,000 employees
              of the Bank completed cybersecurity training, collectively
              accounting more than 76,000 training hours. The training
              equipped the employees with essential knowledge to identify
              cyber threats and uphold the Bank’s cybersecurity standards.

              To further strengthen vigilance, we also conduct periodic
              phishing awareness exercises. These initiatives form a part of our
              broader commitment to business ethics and sound corporate
              governance, which guide every aspect of our operations and
              decision-making. Our processes are designed to uphold the
              highest standards of integrity, transparency and accountability.
