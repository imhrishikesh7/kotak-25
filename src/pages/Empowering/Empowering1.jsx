          The Group’s total employee strength was over 1.39 lakh,
          as on 31 <sup>st</sup> March, 2025, reflecting a 3% YoY increase. This
          included 1.14 lakh full-time staff and 0.25 lakh part-time
          staff <sup>*</sup>. 68% of the Group employees are permanent. Our
          permanent workforce has shown a steady increase YoY.
          There has been a marked decline in contractual roles
          at the Bank and subsidiaries, with KLO being
          the only exception <sup>*</sup>.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-2'>
          We continue to invest in a diverse and inclusive workforce,
          with 42.7% of roles held by individuals under 30 and
          over 1,100 employees under 30 now holding middle
          management positions at the Group. There was a marked
          improvement in gender diversity at the Group in FY 2024-25
          with women accounting for 26.4% of the workforce (25.7%
          in FY 2023-24). In addition, at the Bank, our proportion
          of permanent women employees increased to 27.3%
          from 26.5% in FY 2023-24. Of the total new hires at the
          Group, 25.4% were women.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-2'>
          Employee retention improved with attrition rates for
          permanent employees at the Bank declining 16%, from
          39.6% in FY 2023-24 to 33.3% in FY 2024-25 . There was
          a marked drop in attrition for women from 39.7% in FY
          2023-24 to 32.1% in FY 2024-25. The attrition for mid- and
          senior-management level empolyees was significantly
          lower at 14.8% and 14.0%, respectively, showing notable
          decline over FY 2023-24. The average tenures for mid-
          and senior-management was over six and twelve years,
          respectively. Internal mobility remained a focus, with over
          243 colleagues transitioning to new roles within the Group.

              We ensure a safe and healthy workplace through ISO 45001:2018-certified
              Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS), implemented at
              eight major corporate locations covering over 20% of the Bank’s workforce.
              These sites undergo regular third-party audits and internal evaluations.
              Our OHSMS manual outlines governance, audit protocols, team responsibilities
              and performance metrics, with senior management actively overseeing safety
              outcomes to drive continuous improvement.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              In line with ISO 45001:2018, we conduct regular Hazard Identification and
              Risk Assessment (HIRA) exercises to evaluate and mitigate workplace risks.
              HIRA outcomes are reviewed annually, updated based on incidents and shared
              across locations to strengthen preventive safety measures.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              At our ISO 45001:2018 certified sites, we ensure effective occupational
              health and safety management by considering factors such as work organisation,
              leadership, culture, past incidents, emergency preparedness and evolving hazard
              information. Our Occupational Health and Safety Management Representative (HMR)
              oversees hazard identification, ensuring it is conducted by qualified experts.
              The HMR supervises all site activities, conducts safety ‘Toolbox Talks’ for vendors
              and maintains an up-to-date hazard checklist. Clear methodologies guide systematic
              risk assessments for both routine and non-routine tasks. We ensure employee safety
              through regular fire drills led by trained wardens, preventive health services and
              enhanced workplace safety with slip-resistant flooring and ergonomic seating.

              Employees are encouraged to report hazards via our helpdesk for swift action.
