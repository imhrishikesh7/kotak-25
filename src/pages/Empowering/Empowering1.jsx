          The Group’s total employee strength was over 1.39 lakh,
          as on 31 <sup>st</sup> March, 2025, reflecting a 3% YoY increase. This
          included 1.14 lakh full-time staff and 0.25 lakh part-time
          staff <sup>*</sup>. 68% of the Group employees are permanent. Our
          permanent workforce has shown a steady increase YoY.
          There has been a marked decline in contractual roles
          at the Bank and subsidiaries, with KLI being
          the only exception <sup>*</sup>.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-2'>
          We continue to invest in shaping the workforce of
          tomorrow, with 42.7% of roles held by individuals under
          30 and over 1,100 employees under 30 now holding
          middle management positions at the Group. There was
          a marked improvement in gender diversity at the Group
          in FY 2024-25, with women accounting for 26.4% of the
          workforce (25.7% in FY 2023-24). In addition, at the Bank,
          our proportion of permanent women employees increased
          to 27.3% from 26.5% in FY 2023-24. Of the total new hires at
          the Group, 25.4% were women.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-2'>
          Employee retention improved with attrition rates for
          permanent employees at the Bank declining 16%, from
          39.6% in FY 2023-24 to 33.3% in FY 2024-25 . There was
          a marked drop in attrition for women from 39.7% in FY
          2023-24 to 32.1% in FY 2024-25. The attrition for mid- and

          lower at 14.8% and 14.0%, respectively, showing notable
          decline over FY 2023-24. The average tenures for mid-

            U-Leadership programme was launched to empower women

            development training. Sonata introduced the POWER Club,

            through mentorship and capability-building sessions and the
            SHE SUVIDHA initiative was established as a Women’s Cell to

            on hiring women employees to handle its customers, which
            is observed to be an enabler of increasing women customers.
            Additionally, KSL hosted the Diversity Marathon, a flagship

            as Transcendence, a leadership development programme
            that empowers future women leaders through expert-led,

          Transparent Communication

          We believe open dialogue builds trust and drives
          engagement. Through platforms such as town-halls
          and skip level meetings, leaders maintain direct and
          meaningful connections with colleagues. These forums
          encourage the sharing of ideas, concerns and feedback. To
          further strengthen communication, we have developed
          multiple channels that ensure every Kotakite’s voice
          is heard and valued.

          role in strengthening employee engagement by capturing
          real-time feedback across all stages of tenure and provides
          actionable insights that shape our strategies and decisions.
          With an engagement score of 81/100, Amber continues to be a

              We ensure a safe and healthy workplace through ISO 45001:2018-certified
              Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS), implemented at
              eight major corporate locations covering over 20% of the Bank’s workforce.
              These sites undergo regular third-party audits and internal evaluations.
              Our OHSMS manual outlines governance, audit protocols, team responsibilities
              and performance metrics, with senior management actively overseeing safety
              outcomes to drive continuous improvement.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              In line with ISO 45001:2018, we conduct regular Hazard Identification and
              Risk Assessment (HIRA) exercises to evaluate and mitigate workplace risks.
              HIRA outcomes are reviewed annually, updated based on incidents and shared
              across locations to strengthen preventive safety measures.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              At our ISO 45001:2018 certified sites, we ensure effective occupational
              health and safety management by considering factors such as work organisation,
              leadership, culture, past incidents, emergency preparedness and evolving hazard
              information. Our Occupational Health and Safety Management Representative (HMR)
              oversees hazard identification, ensuring it is conducted by qualified experts.
              The HMR supervises all site activities, conducts safety ‘Toolbox Talks’ for vendors
              and maintains an up-to-date hazard checklist. Clear methodologies guide systematic
              risk assessments for both routine and non-routine tasks. We ensure employee safety
              through regular fire drills led by trained wardens, preventive health services and
              enhanced workplace safety with slip-resistant flooring and ergonomic seating.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              Employees are encouraged to report hazards via our helpdesk for swift action.
              Our learning portal offering digital trainings on safety, covering scenarios like
              robbery, bomb threats and fires, was accessed by 15,217 employees in FY 2024-25.
              OHSMS updates are shared through emails, signage and nodal contacts.

              We enforce a zero-tolerance approach to harassment through our POSH policy, which is
              supported by an internal committee and regular employee training. Over 60% of the
