                  suspicious activity, using the Bank’s fraud reporting helpline
                  or the government cybercrime helpline. The effectiveness
                  of our awareness programmes is reflected through real time
                  instances of staff preventing fraudulent transactions and
                  providing timely alerts to customers. Such proactive efforts of
                  employees are also recognised via ‘Hall of Fame’ and ‘Hawk
                  Eye’ mailers to appreciate them and inspire other employees.

            <p className='mb-2'>
              At one of our Hyderabad branches, a potential fraud
              amounting to approximately ₹ 30 lakh was successfully
              averted due to the vigilance and coordinated efforts of our
              frontline staff. When a senior citizen customer requested
              premature closure of a term deposit and an immediate
              RTGS transfer, our staff sensed unusual behaviour and
              escalated the matter.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              Upon further engagement, it was discovered that the
              customer had been coerced by fraudsters impersonating
              law enforcement officials. The branch team acted swiftly by
              declining the transaction, maintaining communication with
              the customer’s spouse, involving a trusted family friend and
              alerting the customer’s children abroad. After sustained
              efforts, the customer was convinced of the fraudulent
              nature of the threat.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              This incident underscored the impact of our fraud
              awareness training and the critical role of frontline staff
              in protecting vulnerable customers through proactive,
              empathetic intervention.

            <p className='mb-2'>
              At one of our branches in Pondicherry, a high-value fraud
              attempt involving ₹ 75 lakh was successfully intercepted
              through the vigilance and persistence of our branch
              team. A long-standing HNI customer arrived in a visibly
              distressed state, urgently requesting a large RTGS transfer.
              His behaviour raised immediate red flags as he was
              evasive, uncommunicative and appeared to be under
              external pressure. When verbal communication proved
              ineffective, the team resorted to written notes to discreetly
              assess the situation.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              The branch contacted the beneficiary bank, which
              confirmed suspicious activity in the recipient account.
              Further engagement revealed that the customer had
              been coerced via a video call by fraudsters impersonating
              government officials. The team’s calm, methodical
              approach which was grounded in recent internal fraud
              awareness training, ultimately convinced the customer to
              disengage and report the incident.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              Their timely intervention not only prevented a significant
              financial loss but also reinforced the customer’s trust in the
              Bank’s commitment to their safety and well-being.

                  with the Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines, we have also
                  institutionalised the role of an Internal Ombudsman which is an
                  independent authority whose decisions are binding on the Bank.

                KSL has embraced a structured and insight-driven approach
                to enhance customer satisfaction and service quality. A
                formal service recovery mechanism ensures that unresolved
                issues are addressed comprehensively, while detractor
                feedback is systematically analysed to generate actionable

                such as operations, product and training to drive targeted

                feedback to its process improvement team, ensuring continuous

                  Our initiatives mentioned so far are delivering measurable
                  impact. Our AI- and ML-powered tools proactively identified
                  potential escalations and helped resolve issues before they
                  intensified. Additionally, validations and automated execution
                  of service requests through APIs streamlined the service
                  request journey, resulting in 40% of requests being processed automatically. These interventions supported by a dedicated
                  Kaizen team, led to 28% YoY reduction in net complaints and
                  9.13% YoY decrease in Banking Ombudsman complaints. These
                  initiatives also contributed to the increase in R–NPS score that
                  measures overall customer satisfaction.
