                The Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) framework
                provides a unified and integrated approach to managing risks,
                enabling the group to balance risk and return while driving long-term sustainability, shareholder value creation and financial
                strength. The framework also supports delivery of customer-centric products and services. The ERM policy, which guides
                the ERM framework, forms the basis for risk management
                across the group, with tailored modifications for individual
                businesses. A suite of policies and procedures supports this
                framework, providing clear guidelines for managing specific
                risks and aligning risk mitigation with business objectives.
                By integrating risk management into our core operations, we
                ensure a balanced approach that maximises opportunities while
                minimising potential losses. Refer to ‘Management’s Discussion

                  and the most complex risk. As banking becomes increasingly
                  digital, traditional risk boundaries blur, creating interconnected
                  vulnerabilities requiring holistic management approaches. Our
                  strategy acknowledges this complexity while maintaining focus
                  on fundamental risk principles.

                  The pace of technological change accelerates annually —
                  systems considered cutting-edge today may become obsolete
                  tomorrow. This reality shapes our investment philosophy as
                  we focus on building flexible, scalable architectures capable
                  of evolving rather than rigid systems requiring wholesale
                  replacement. We emulate this philosophy in dealing with the
                  various core technology risks and the risks that arise due to
                  rapid technology evolution. Detailed explanation on technology

                This includes physical risk which arises from the impact of

            A dedicated ESG function within our Bank focuses on addressing
            ESG and climate risks. The Heads of CSR and ESG and the
            Head of Sustainability hold direct accountability and a Whole
            Time Director provides oversight and guides this function.
            This function works closely with business units to ensure that
            best practices in environmental and social responsibility are
            integrated into the services we provide. We also use ratings as a
            tool to understand the ESG risks faced by the Bank and use the
            analysis to address these risks. Details on how we address ESG

            Considering the escalating threat of climate-related risks to the
            broader economy, we undertook a forward-looking, scenario-based assessment of climate risk and opportunities in FY
            2022-23 and FY 2023-24, in alignment with global guidelines.
            We have employed a two-pronged approach to understand

                  To identify transition risks in the Bank’s corporate
                  lending portfolio, we are adopting a sectoral approach,
                  analysing two scenarios informed by global guidelines
                  and India’s net zero commitments. The focus sectors
                  include Power Generation (FY 2022-23) and Cement
                  Manufacturing (FY 2023-24). These ongoing climate risk
                  assessments have given insight into portfolio emissions,
                  data challenges and emerging sectoral technologies. As
                  this is an evolving process, we are proactively addressing
                  challenges, monitoring emerging developments and
                  refining our methodologies to enhance reliability of

              The advent of climate change presents both risks and
              opportunities for financial institutions. While it poses significant

              a compelling business case for banks to play a pivotal role
              in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are
