                    both infrastructure and applications with a dual objective-
                    ‘run the Bank’ and ‘change the Bank’. During the year, the
                    Bank overhauled its core banking architecture, reducing
                    the system load to improve reliability of the system at scale,
                    improved observability of the platform through central

                    integrity through specific Personally Identifiable Information
                    frameworks. In addition to the Tech infrastructure
                    investments, we have also created a highly capable tech
                    organisation which will be critical to ensure the Bank is agile

        <p>
          We continue to leverage technology for scalability while also
          ensuring time and cost-efficient operations. We have revamped
          our internal processes to enable the customer to ‘Do-It-Yourself’
          (DIY) and empowering our workforce with tech-enabled tools
          like ‘Straight through Processing’ frameworks to efficiently
          service the growing customer base, improving productivity and
          turnaround times. Some of the key focus areas are:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-[#14216c]">Operational Efficiency:  </strong>
          We continue to expand our market
          share across businesses, bringing scale-led efficiency.
          Additionally, we will continue to invest in various digital
          initiatives and technology infrastructure to acquire customers
          and enrich service delivery, thereby optimising associated
          costs on a per unit basis. This will also make internal operations
          more efficient. Revamped customer journeys and process
          re-engineering initiatives will further help us achieve deeper
          relationships and cost efficiencies associated with lean processes. The Bank has launched <i>Voice Channel</i> for managing
          customers that may need assistance in their DIY journeys without
          requirement of branch visits.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-[#14216c]">Employee Productivity: </strong>
          We endeavour to consistently improve
          employee productivity levels and have identified technology,
          automation and straight-through-processing as critical enablers
          to achieve this objective. Automating repetitive tasks not only
          helps in reducing costs, but creates customer delight leading
          to an increased customer wallet-share and improved operating
          leverage. We are also focus on placing the right tools in the
          hands of our colleagues, especially at the front lines, to enrich
          the quality of engagement with customers, thereby enabling
          superior outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are also implementing Gen AI led processes for our
          employees to efficiently service customers, including Kotak AIpowered Virtual assistants for automatic, prompt resolution of routine customer queries. We have also introduced two Agentic
          AI tools to improve our employee productivity – ‘Kompanion’ – a
          conversational AI agent for the frontline staff and ‘Koder’ – for
          our software developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-[#14216c]">Capital:  </strong>
          We plan our capital with the objective of meeting
          regulatory and business requirements, while striking a balance
          between risk-reward on the capital to be deployed. We will
          continue to maintain Tier-I capital in excess of the regulatory
          requirements and will continue to ensure that the Credit-to-Deposit ratio remains within acceptable levels.

          Our asset growth strategy continues to
          focus on granular, high-quality and sustainable businesses.
          We continue to increase the base of Jan Dhan accounts to
          lower-income groups, distribute government-sponsored
          lending/insurance schemes and offer services such as Aadhar
          Enabled Payment Systems through our branch and Business
          Correspondent (BC) network. Our digital ecosystem has
          further opened opportunities to offer financial services to
          a vast population by leveraging the partner network. We
          continue to explore fintech partnerships for new use cases
          and business models.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-[#14216c]">Compliance: </strong>
          We will continue to follow a comprehensive
          compliance framework to ensure adherence to all the
          regulatory requirements at all times. We maintain transparency
          in communication with stakeholders, including customers,
          employees, investors and regulators.

          <strong className="text-[#14216c]">Sustainable and Responsible Banking:  </strong>
          We continue to
          focus on addressing carbon footprint and promoting resource
