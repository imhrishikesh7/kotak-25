                    During FY 2024-25, we undertook a comprehensive upgrade of the
                    technology infrastructure and enhanced the UI/UX and core features of
                    its apps and platforms. This transformation was driven by the strategic
                    belief that building a resilient, secure and scalable core is fundamental
                    to delivering improved customer experiences in an increasingly digital-first world. These efforts also resulted in resolving the regulatory
                    restrictions highlighted in the RBI Order dated 24th April, 2024,
                    which were subsequently removed by its letter dated 12th February, 2025.
